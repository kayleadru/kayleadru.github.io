	<h2>Darrell's New Cage</h2> 
<p>When we found Darrell we had to have a place to put him so we got him a box. After that box got thrown away we got him a small shoe box. After about a week or so he chewed out of the shoe box. Then we got him a plastic box with some hole in the top and after a few weeks he chewed through that one too. So then we went to tractor supply and got him a bunny cage. Now he can't chew out of it so we don't have to worry about him getting out. </p>

	<h3>Runaway Squirrel</h3>
<p>One day while we were at school Darrell chewed out of his box and got lost in my sisters closet and we could not find him. We pulled everything out of the closet just to find him. After hours of searching we finally found him in the bottom of the closet. Since then we have not put him in a cardboard or plastic box. </p>
