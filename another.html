<h2>Darrells Favorite Food</h2> 

<p>Darrells favorite food is pecans. Which is normal since he is a squirrel. He loves pecans. He eats pecans for breakfast, lunch, 
and dinner. Darrell eats about 30 pecans a day! My sister feeds him pecans all the time and he takes them and eats them. He takes 
pecans out of our hands and runs and eats them.</p>

<h3>Darrells Adventures </h3>

<p>Some days my sister lets Darrell run around the house while we are at home. Some days he runs up and down the halls. He runs 
under the couch and behind the pillows. Darrell is very fast and hard to catch sometimes but we always get him back to go in his
cage. </p>
