    <h2 style="text-align:center">Finding Darrell</h2> 

<p> One night while we were at a friend's house, we heard there was a squirrel outside. When we went out to look for him,
we found him at the bottom of the tree. After looking at him for about 10 minutes, I picked him up, and he immediately fell 
asleep in my hand. We went to the store and got him a bottle and some puppy milk. After trying to feed him for 20 minutes, 
we realized he didn't want the milk, so we gave him water, and he drank all of it. He wouldn't eat anything we gave him so my 
sister went out and found a pecan and he ate it in like 30 seconds.  </p>
