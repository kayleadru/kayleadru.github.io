<h2>Finding Darrell</h2> 
	    

<p> One night while we were at a friend's house, we heard there was a squirrel outside. When we went out to look for him,
we found him at the bottom of the tree. After looking at him for about 10 minutes, I picked him up, and he immediately fell 
asleep in my hand. We went to the store and got him a bottle and some puppy milk. After trying to feed him for 20 minutes, 
we realized he didn't want the milk, so we gave him water, and he drank all of it. He wouldn't eat anything we gave him so my 
sister went out and found a pecan and he ate it in like 30 seconds.</p>

	<h3>The Screaming Squirrel</h3>
<p> One day when me and my sister were singing and listening to music in the bathroom Darrell was running around on the floor.
Then we the music went off we heard a very high pitched screaming noise. Looking around for what it could have been we couldn't
figure out what made that noise. Then, Darrell jumped up on the counter top and screamed again. After that we knew what had 
made that sound, it was Darrell. Now every time the dog gets close to him he screams and the dog runs away.</p>
