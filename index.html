<h1>Darrell the Squirrel Stories:</h1>


<h2>The Screaming Squirrel!</h2>
<p>The other day as I was singing in the mirror Darrell was running around on the floor. I started singing louder and louder. 
When in paused the music to find a new song, Darrell let out a veryyyy high pitched sound. I was looking around to figure out what 
it was then I realized it was Darrell. </p>
